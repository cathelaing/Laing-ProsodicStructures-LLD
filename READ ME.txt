Script: ProsodicStructuresAnalysis.Rmd

This is the script that runs all of the code to generate the analysis for this paper.


ProsodicStructuresData.csv: This is the main dataset for the analysis, including only infant productions.
The dataset incorporates the following variables:


Infant: Infant name, as determined by the Providence or Lyon corpora (Demuth et al., 2006; Demuth & Tremblay, 2008)

Language: Infant's ambient language

Record: Video or Diary data

Session: Session 1, 2 or 3 (Video data) or Session 1-10 (Diary data)

Class: OW (onomatopoeic word), CW (conventional word) or RW (regular word)

Target: Target word, as transcribed by the original coders. 

Gloss: Where target is not English, the translation is shown here.

nTokens: Number of times the target was produced in that infant's session

Structure: Prosodic structure, determined by the author and verified by the reliability coding

SelAd: Selected (matches structure of target form) or Adapted (does not match structure of target form)


CGinput.csv: This is the data for the analysis of caregiver input. It follows the same list of variables as in ProsodicStructuresData.csv, listed above.

SD1.xslx: Supplementary data showing phonetic transcription of all OWs and CWs in the analysis. RWs have been removed as data is not all publicly available.
